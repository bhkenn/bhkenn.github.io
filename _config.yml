 My name is Braxton Kenney, and I am currently a junior at West Virginia University. I am seeking a degree in Management Information Systems with a minor in Business Cybersecurity and Military Science. 
 I aspire to have a career in technology after graduation from WVU. 
 I am currently a member of WVU Army ROTC, and the West Virginia Army National Guard. 
 In my free time I love to tinker with technology, play games, and ride my motorcycle.

           In my position of Webmaster for the WVHSSCA, I am responsible for the development and maintenance of the association's website. 
           This site receives traffic from high soccer coaches and players across the state of West Virginia. 
           I work closely with my professor, who is a WVHSSCA officer, to implement the wants and needs of the association.
           I am currently in the process of a complete redesign of the website to allow easier communication between coaches, as well as a more rebust system for paying dues.

          As a cadet in the West Virginia Army National Guard, I attend drill weekends and other training with my unit in order to gain valuable knowledge and experience.
          During these trainings I complete tasks for the unit officers and observe functions to better prepare myself for when I am an officer.
          After I graduate from WVU I will commission as an officer in the National Guard, and this experience will be invaluable when I am leading those much older than myself.
